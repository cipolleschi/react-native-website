This section is the entry point for the new guide’s documentation.
It contains some basic information about the New Architecture: its pillars, the version from which it has been made available and other very high-level information. Then, it should present the guide’s structure itself.

This section should also contains a sort of Driving guide based on the user use-cases:

- New user: link to how to use the new [app template](use-app-template)
- New Library developer: link to the [pillars](pillars)
- Old library developer/app developer: link to [the migration guide](../new-architecture-intro)
